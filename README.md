# Wine-Quality-Prediction

Developed various **classification models** in Machine Learning, to classify wine quality as good or bad, depending upon features like acidity, citric acid, chlorides, density, pH, etc.
The different models used were: **Logistic Classification Method** , **Random Forest Classifier** ,**k-NN **(Nearest Neighbors), **XGBoost Classifier**. 

Their performances were then **compared** on the basis of Testing Accuracy and Training Accuracy.

**Libraries/Frameworks used:** NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scykit-learn, matplotlib
